# node6-awscli
Docker image deriving from node:6 and containing AWS CLI tools


NOTE: If this becomes useful for anyone to themselves derive from, and/or would like to see other node versions also including AWS CLI tools (or the same node version including different virtual hosting supplier tools like Google Cloud Platform) just let me know either in the comments or via my GitHub with the same username
