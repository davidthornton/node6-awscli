# node6-awscli
Docker image deriving from node:6 and containing AWS CLI tools

NOTE: If this becomes useful for anyone to themselves derive from, and/or would like to see other node versions also including AWS CLI tools (or the same node version including different virtual hosting supplier tools like Google Cloud Platform) just let me know either in the comments or via my GitHub with the same username

NOTE: Weirdly, it has come up that Cloud Front is not available to be used by this AWS CLI client - if this is fixed any anyone uses it, again, let me know and I will recompile the Docker image
